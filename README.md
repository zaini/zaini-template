# Zaini Template

Welcome to the Zaini Template! This starter template is set up with a modern stack of technologies to help you kickstart your web development projects. Below you'll find all the necessary information to get started, including the technologies used, setup instructions, and useful links.

## Technologies Used

This template uses the following technologies and frameworks:

- **[Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)**: A powerful framework for building React applications with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types for improved developer experience and code quality.
- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: A library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing custom user interfaces.
- **[shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/)**: A collection of UI components for building beautiful interfaces.
- **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)**: A fast and reliable package manager.
- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**: An ORM for interacting with databases. This template uses SQLite for development. For production environments, PostgreSQL is recommended as Vercel does not support SQLite.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Zaini Template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Your application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Seeding the Database**:

   You can seed your database by running:

   ```bash
   yarn seed
   ```

   This will populate your database with initial data.

## Notes

- **Production Database**: For production, switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL as Vercel does not support SQLite.
- **Seed File**: The `seed.ts` file is included to help you seed the database with initial data.
